Hospital for Special Surgery Tekscan Analysis Programs

This software was developed to overcome some of the limitations of the Tekscan I-Scan software. While this software is tailored towards the analysis of knee joint contact mechanics using the Tekscan 4010N and 4011 sensors, a majority of the analysis is generic enough to be used for other use cases and sensor types. Included with the code are example files that users can use to run through the code. These files have been validated by the authors to work with all aspects of the code.
